I can now see all the open tickets I created in the "Tickets" tab:


When clicking on a ticket I can see all the information about the ticket like its priority, SLA, creation date, and more:



I can change the priority level on appropriate tickets by clicking the "Priority" section and can add a note for the change made:



To assign a ticket, click on "Unassigned" next to the "Assigned To" section and select an agent to assign this ticket to:


I can also change the tickets SLA (Service Level Agreement) of the ticket in the "SLA Plan" section:



Another option I have is to change the tickets department in the "Department" section:



Looking further down I can see a thread of all of the changes made to the ticket:



At the bottom I can post replies communicating updates of the ticket:



If I go back to see all the open tickets, I can see the changes I made to the ticket:

To resolve a ticket, I can select "Resolved" from the "Ticket Status" menu at the bottom of the ticket:

The resolved ticket will disappear from the open tickets tab and appear in the closed tickets tab:
